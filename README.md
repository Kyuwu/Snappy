# Snappy
#### (Formerly XIVSnapper)

### A forked and maintained mod originally based on work by @eqbot, and previously managed by @ViviAshe. 

### What is it?
Ever had a friend ask you to share your character’s appearance because it looked especially sharp that day - only to realize you’d have to dig through your mod list or settle for the limited Mare Character Data Format (MCDF)? Snappy solves that problem.

Snappy is a plugin designed to save and load your character’s full appearance - mods and all - with a single click. No restrictions, no compromises. It creates a single-character mod collection that captures everything exactly as it is. That means you can share your setup with friends, and they can load your character just as you see it, then customize it however they like. No more relying on MCDF. Just a clean, accurate snapshot of your character, ready to use.

### Where to get it:
Add this custom repo to Dalamud (check their documentation if you’re unfamiliar with that process):

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astrodoobs/plugins/main/Plugins.json`

### How to use it:
1. **Set a working directory** in the settings menu.
  - Optionally, also set a Glamourer Fallback string in case the plugin can't get your Glamourer string. 
2. **To save snapshots**: Press the save icon.
  - If you already have a Snapshot, you can append to the existing save. **Hitting the `save` icon while having a Snapshot appends for you.**
3. **To load snapshots**:
   - Enter GPose.
   - Select an actor.
   - Use the Load button to pick a snapshot folder.
   - Best performance comes from using [Brio](https://github.com/AsgardXIV/Brio)-spawned actors. I test against those, and if you load onto anything else, you're on your own. Fixes for that won’t be a priority.

### Disclaimer:
I am acutely aware of the controversial nature of this plugin. I've decided to maintain this plugin as it's served incredible purpose to me for GPosing myself and my friends. This tool is being maintained explicitly for character customization and mod sharing. Nothing more, nothing less. It’s here to make it easier to preserve, export, and share the way a character looks, especially among friends or within a private modding circle. That’s it.

For the love of all that’s decent, use this like a reasonable adult. Use it in good faith. Do **not** use it for creepy, inappropriate, or what I call 'goonish' behavior. Do **not** use it to pirate paid mods, and **do not** use it to exploit characters that aren’t your own. This plugin retains its original ability to capture appearances from other players: what this means is that if they’re using mods, you’ll obtain them too. That makes consent **absolutely** a **non-negotiable**. Always ask. Always get permission. If you’re using this tool without consent, you’re crossing a hard line that I can neither support nor tolerate. Support the creators who pour countless hours into their work. Their time is not free. It’s a priceless currency, and it deserves your respect. If your first instinct is to twist this tool into something it was never meant for, congratulations: ***you’re the problem***. Don’t be that person. Just because the technology allows something doesn’t mean you should do it.

If this existence of this mod upsets you, understand this: it is being maintained with honest, transparent, and constructive intentions. Its purpose, while I maintain it, will always serve primarily as utility and never exploitation. It’s about preserving creativity, not crossing lines. **Yes**, I maintain this project. **No**, I am not responsible for how others choose to misuse it. I cannot police the internet, and I won’t pretend like I can. What I *can* do is ensure the tool is accessible, functional, and clear in what it’s meant for. Beyond that, the responsibility lies with the user, including how **you** interact with the game and with mods. The ability to capture someone’s mods, glamourer setup, and overall character appearance already exists, *with or without* this plugin. The methods this tool uses are not new. If you're synced on Mare - **especially** on Syncshells, your mods will, guaranteed, be at risk of being captured and your character's appearance replicated. **That’s the reality.** So if you're concerned, **sync responsibly**, know the risks, know the tools, and act accordingly.
